# Tutorial

Hello!
This tutorial is an introduction to the process of developing applications on Optimistic Ethereum.
Specifically, we'll take you through the process of building, testing, deploying, and interacting with a Solidity smart contract on top of the platform.

Planned future iterations of this tutorial will include:
- Communicating between Optimistic Ethereum and Ethereum.
- Using more advanced Optimism tooling.

## Prerequisite Software
We make use of some external software throughout this tutorial.
Please make sure you've installed the following before continuing:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Setting Up
We've structured this tutorial as a follow-along exercise where we'll be writing code in tandem.
Please clone and enter [this repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial
cd optimism-tutorial
```

We're using an Ethereum development framework called [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) to make our lives a lot easier.
If you haven't used Hardhat before, we hope you'll be pleasantly surprised!
Hardhat is well designed and full of useful features.
Go ahead and set up Hardhat by running:

```sh
yarn install
```

We'll be writing all of our smart contracts in Solidity and writing the rest of our code in TypeScript.

## The Task
We're going to be deploying an ERC20 contract (written in Solidity) to Optimistic Ethereum.
We've already gone ahead and written that contract for you, which you should be able to locate in [`optimism-tutorial/contracts/ERC20.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol).
This contract is just a relatively standard (though completely unsafe) ERC20 implementation.

(**Note**: Seriously! This implementation is unsafe! Don't use it in production!)

We'd recommend running the following command to compile this ERC20 contract.
This will also make sure that Hardhat is installed correctly:

```sh
yarn compile
```

## The Tests
We've also written some very basic tests for you, which you can locate in [`optimism-tutorial/test/erc20.spec.ts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/test/erc20.spec.ts).
Though tests are pretty straight forward, we'd recommend taking a quick read through the test file.
We're using [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) for the majority of our testing and [Waffle](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for some of its utilities.
Hardhat provides convenient plugins for both; we've already added these plugins to [`optimism-tutorial/hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).

Once you've taken a look at the tests, feel free to verify that everything is working correctly by running the following command:

```sh
yarn test
```

If everything is going as planned, you should see a bunch of green checkmarks.

## Making it Optimistic
Now that we've gotten that out of the way, it's time to get our ERC20 ready for Optimistic Ethereum.
Contracts deployed to Optimistic Ethereum are required to [replace certain EVM opcodes with custom behavior](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/evm-comparison.html#missing-replaced-and-custom-opcodes).
Since the Solidity compiler doesn't handle this custom behavior, developers have to make sure to use the Optimism fork of the Solidity compiler instead.
We'll need to add a special plugin to hardhat that enables this custom Optimism Solidity compiler.

First, add the Optimism plugins package to your project:

```sh
yarn add @eth-optimism/plugins
```

Next, add the following line to [`optimism-tutorial/hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts):

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts

import '@eth-optimism/plugins/hardhat/compiler'
```

Finally, compile it!

```sh
yarn compile
```

Congrats, you're ready to deploy an application to Optimistic Ethereum!
It really is that easy.

You can verify that everything went well by checking the `artifacts` folder that should be generated whenever you run `yarn compile`.
Alongside the normal compiler output located at `artifacts/contracts/ERC20.sol/ERC20.json`, you should also see `artifacts/contracts/ERC20.sol/ERC20-ovm.json` (or `artifacts/contracts/ERC20.sol/ERC20.ovm.json` if you're using an older version of `@eth-optimism/plugins`).
Here, `-ovm.json` signifies that this file has been compiled for the OVM, the **O**ptimistic **V**irtual **M**achine, as opposed to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

### Running Optimistic Ethereum locally

For the awesome tests that you _really_ came here for, you're going to need to deploy your ERC20 contract to Optimistic Ethereum.
Fortunately, we have a handy dandy [integrations repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-integration) all set for you to run your own local instance of Optimistic Ethereum!

Let's get our local instance setup by running these commands:

```sh
optimism-tutorial % git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/optimism-integration.git --recurse-submodules
optimism-tutorial % cd optimism-integration
optimism-tutorial % ./pull.sh
```

<!-- @platocrat One-liner
git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/optimism-integration.git --recurse-submodules && cd optimism-integration && ./pull.sh && ./up.sh
-->

What we're doing here first is cloning the `optimism-integration` repo, which comes with a dockerized sequencer L2 chain (OVM) and a dockerzied L1 chain (EVM).
Then, we enter the top level directory of your newly cloned (local) repo.
Next, we run the `./pull.sh` command to pull all the docker images to start your local instance.

Lastly, we'll run the `./up.sh` command to start your docker containers up:

```sh
optimism-tutorial % ./up.sh
```

(NOTE: These last two commands are provided by shell scripts that we created for you ðŸ˜Š.)
The containers will take some time to fully spin up, but once they do, you should see something like this flash by in the logs at some point (NOTE: These logs are not important and are only shared to confirm you're running Optimistic Ethereum correctly.):

![Local OE Network Logs 1](./assets/optimistic-ethereum-local-instance-log1.png)
![Local OE Network Logs 2](./assets/optimistic-ethereum-local-instance-log2.png)

You now have your very own locally deployed instance of Optimistic Ethereum! ðŸ™Œ
(NOTE: Keep these containers running! We'll be using your new local instance of Optimistic Ethereum to deploy and then test your contract.)

### Deploying to Optimistic Ethereum

<!-- 1. Intro `hardhat-deploy` -->
With your local Optimistic Ethereum network ready to go, we'll now need to deploy our contract to the local (Optimistic) L2 chain instance.
To do that, we'll be using the helpful [`hardhat-deploy`](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) plugin to simplify contract deployment with deploy scripts (`hardhat-deploy` will also later help with our post-deploy tests).

Let's start by adding `hardhat-deploy` with the following command:
```sh
optimism-tutorial % yarn add hardhat-deploy
```

Now, we're able to start writing our deploy script.
First, we'll want to create a directory called `deploy` and create our deploy script.
You can do both with the following commands:
```sh
optimism-tutorial % mkdir deploy
optimism-tutorial % cd deploy
optimism-tutorial % touch deployERC20.ts
```

Since we're using TypeScript, we'll start editing our new deploy script by adding types for `hardhat-deploy` and `hardhat` for static type checking.
So, let's add the following imports to your `deployERC20.ts` like so:
```typescript
import {HardhatRuntimeEnvironment} from 'hardhat/types'
import {DeployFunction} from 'hardhat-deploy/types'
```

Next, we'll start by writing our main deploy function, like so (which we'll show you first, then explain how it works):
```typescript
const func: DeployFunction = async (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {

  const { deployments, getNamedAccounts } = hre
  const { deploy} = deployments

  const { deployer, simpleERC20Beneficiary } = await getNamedAccounts()

  await deploy('SimpleERC20', {
    from: deployer,
    args: [simpleERC20Beneficiary, parseEther('1000000000')],
    log: true,
  });
};

export default func
func.tags = ['SimpleERC20']
```



// import {parseEther} from 'ethers/lib/utils'

<!-- 2. Describe how contracts will be deployed with `hardhat-deploy` -->


<!-- 3. Walk through to add `hardhat-deploy` -->


<!-- 4. Config the plugin to deploy the sample ERC20 -->


<!-- 5. Fun closing! (and transition to testing) -->

### Testing (Again)
We provided you with an ERC20 test file earlier in this tutorial.
Now it's time to test this ERC20 again.
This time, however, we'll be testing our new OVM-compatible smart contract on top of Optimistic Ethereum.


<!-- 1. Explain integration vs. unit testing -->


<!-- 2. Why we're doing integration testing and not unit testing -->


<!-- 3. Write first unit test! -->


<!-- 4. Another one. -->


<!-- 5. Another one. -->


<!-- 6. Another one. -->

// Some guidance on additional resources that _go deeper_ (e.g. `deposit-withdrawal`, Synthetix repos)

LEAVE COMMENTED OUT UNTIL MAINTENANCE FOR `@eth-optimism/plugins` RENEWS

Luckily, this is almost as easy as compiling the contract!

First, make a copy of [`optimism-tutorial/test/erc20.spec.ts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/test/erc20.spec.ts).
You can name the copy whatever you'd like, perhaps `optimistic-erc20.spec.ts`.
We'll modify this copy in just a minute.

Now we're going to add another Hardhat plugin to [`optimism-tutorial/hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts):

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts

import '@eth-optimism/plugins/hardhat/compiler' // You already had this one.
import '@eth-optimism/plugins/hardhat/ethers'   // Now just add this one!
```

This plugin adds a new modified version of `ethers` to Hardhat that makes it possible to test the Layer 2 version of your contracts.

Finally, we're going to modify `optimistic-erc20.spec.ts` (or whatever you named your copy of the original test file).
Don't worry though, we only have to change a single line of code to make everything work!
Find the line of code that looks like this:

```ts
// optimistic-erc20.spec.ts

import { ethers } from 'hardhat'
```

Now, replace that line of code with this:

```ts
// optimistic-erc20.spec.ts

import { l2ethers as ethers } from 'hardhat'
```

You might also want to change the test description so that you can tell the difference between the normal ERC20 and this new test file:

```ts
// optimistic-erc20.spec.ts

describe('Optimistic ERC20', () => {
    ...
```

You're all set!
Confirm that everything worked as expected by running:

```sh
yarn test
```

You should see even more green checkmarks this time around.
